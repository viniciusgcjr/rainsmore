    "## Configuring your Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process and apply high-end Python algorithms to weather data, first you should ensure you have a suitable Python setup configured on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you to go for conda, i.e., for [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (for a full 3 GB conda installation) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (for a smaller conda installation about 400 MB). \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda/Miniconda is a multiplatform Python distribution which is delivered and installed (usually) independently of the Python distributions that are already part of most operating systems (especially the Linux-based ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a Linux-operating system, many of your official system packages depend on (possibly different versions) of Python. Thus, opting for conda, you will be able to setup a Python ecosystem totally independent of that of your Linux system, avoiding potential conflicts among such different Python distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Windows, conda may be the assumedly default Python distribution to be installed, which should adjust to your system smoothly when following its installer instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation instructions presented here assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. that you are using a Linux-based system;\n",
    "2. that you will go for Miniconda, and;\n",
    "\n",
    "are based on the installation instructions for Miniconda contained [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda installation instructions for other operating systems can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install miniconda on your system\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Minoconda installer for Linux from this [link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and install the downloaded Miniconda distribution by running the command ```bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh```\n",
    "3. Close your terminal and open a new terminal to test if conda can now be found into your system by running the command ```conda --version```. If you get an answer like ```conda 4.14.0``` then everything is fine. If not, you may have to add conda to the PATH of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an environment for your project\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a minimal conda distribution. Thus, it does not come with all packages by default and you are supposed  to install them manually afterwards as required. Since you may have multiple Python projects, which may have different requirements, it is important to create environments to keep them suitably separated, avoiding conflicts. To create a Python environment with Miniconda with your latest Python interpreter, you should issue the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda create -n <environment_name>```\n",
    "\n",
    "where ```<environment_name>``` should be replaced by the name of the environment you are creating for your project. For example, para the Rainsmore Workshop, you could issue the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda create -n rainsmore```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you created an environment, you should activate it before you start using it. For this, issue the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda activate <environment_name>```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our particular example, one would have\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda activate rainsmore```\n",
    "\n",
    "In most Linux terminals, the name of your active environment should appear next to the terminal prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Installing the most commonly required packages\n",
    "\n",
    "With your environment activated, you can install the packages required by the project of this environment using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install <package_name_1> <package_name_2> ... <package_name_n>``` \n",
    "\n",
    "where the ```<package_name_1> <package_name_2> ... <package_name_n>``` should be replaced by the names of the packages you wish to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all particular case, we will require the following packages to be installed\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install numpy scipy jupyter ipython matplotlib pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow```\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation of each of these packages may be found in Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "For machine learning, a good reference to start with is ___Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems___ by ___Aurélien Géron___.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivating the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "After you finish working with your environment, you can deactivate it issuing the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda deactivate```\n",
    "\n"
